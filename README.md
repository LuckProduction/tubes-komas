## About Mewing

Mewing is a non-medical technique that involves flattening your tongue against the roof of your mouth to define your jawline. The technique is named after Dr. Mike Mew, a British orthodontist, who originated it in the 1970s. Some say that mewing can:
- Realign teeth
- Improve facial aesthetics
- Stop mouth breathing
- Resolve sleep apnea
- Resolve swallowing problems
- Treat speech disorders
- Improve jaw pain and dysfunction
- Treat sinusitis 


## Basic Instructions Mewing

The basic instructions for mewing are:
1. Close your lips
2. Move your jaw so that your front bottom teeth are just behind your front upper teeth
3. Cover the roof of your mouth with your tongue
4. Place the tip of your tongue right behind your front teeth without touching 

However, there is little evidence to support these claims. The American Association of Orthodontists does not recommend unsupervised attempts to alter teeth or bite alignment. Experts have warned that people with jaw issues needing surgery or orthodontic work shouldn't try mewing. 

Some say that they see results within weeks, while others say it takes months or even years. Scott Cardall, DMD, owner of Orem Orthodontics in Utah, says a scientific study would be necessary to assess how many hours it would take to see results.
